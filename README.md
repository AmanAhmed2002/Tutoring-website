## üåü Project Overview

This repository contains two main components:

- **Backend** (`/backend`)  
  A Django application exposing RESTful endpoints for user management, resource delivery, and SMTP-powered messaging; includes a customized Django admin dashboard for content and user governance.

- **Frontend** (`/frontend`)  
  A React single-page application that lets students browse PDF notes by subject/grade, send messages to the site owner via a contact form, and navigate a clean, mobile-friendly UI.
